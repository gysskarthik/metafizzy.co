Metafizzy is 8 years old.

## Projects

_The fun talk._ Here's what I got done in the past year.

+ [Flickity fullscreen & hash](/blog/flickity-v2-1-fullscreen-hash)
+ [Windex v2](/blog/windex-pretty-localhost)
+ [Metafizzy socks](/blog/metafizzy-socks-now-on-sale)
+ [Round 3D demos](https://codepen.io/collection/nZrQqe/) and accompanying talk: _Vanilla 3D tastes like the 90's_
+ [Inktober modern logos](/blog/inktober-2018-modern-logos)
+ [Read color hex codes](/blog/read-color-hex-codes)
+ 10 logo jobs

[2017](https://metafizzy.co/blog/7) was dominated by fatherhood. Before the kid, I had ample time to spend between work, side-projects, fitness, and friends. Them days are long gone. My routine had to be overhauled to accomodate being a 50/50 parent. Work took a big hit.

My aim was to re-group in 2018. I had to be more disciplined about what hours I did have available. Looking back, I'm relieved that I was able to ship these projects. The [Round 3D pet project](https://codepen.io/collection/nZrQqe/) was made in quiet hours post-bedtime, in response to wasting away my tired-dad hours of 2017.

I'm particularly proud of the [hex codes talk](/blog/read-color-hex-codes). In an effort to overcome my previous lackluster on-stage performances, I hunkered down in October to put together a talk on a persnickety topic of mine. Presenting at [dotCSS in Paris](https://2018.dotcss.io/) was a thrill. Seeing the [big response to the talk](https://twitter.com/desandro/status/1067781872976044033) felt like validating a job well done.

## Looking forward

Now, _the real talk_. Here is a chart of Metafizzy's revenue for the past 8 years:

![Metafizzy 8 years revenue](/img/2019/8th-revenue.png)

I see two trends:

+ Revenue grew in the years 2011-2015, when I was working on Metafizzy least.
+ Revenue plateaued and then took a big drop in the years 2015-2018, when I working on Metafizzy full-time.

The conclusion I come to is that _I got lucky_. Although I've been working on the business more actively, revenue hasn't changed for the better. Metafizzy's success has been largely market-driven. Isotope was the right piece of software at the right time. I've been able to ride that lucky wave for a while.

I've been working on Metafizzy for 8 years, 4 years full-time. It's the longest full-time job I've ever had. I love it and want to keep going. But I'm in a way different place now then when I first started. I've got mortgage payments and diapers to worry about. Each year the prospect of staying full-time with Metafizzy has been looking more and more shaky.

It's important to share what's really going on here, rather than perpetuate a misrepresentation. In the age of social media, there is a tendency to share the best version of yourself. And if you're an independent business operator, this means projecting a narrative that business is booming and each year is better than the last. But, doing so, you miss out on a better perks of being independent: honesty.

I'm staying the course for now. But big changes may be ahead, just like they always can be.

Oh yeah, [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com) turns 10 this year.
