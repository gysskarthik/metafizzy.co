DC area buddy [Ben Hong has been pumping out front-end dev wisdom like wild](https://www.bencodezen.io/).  He pinged me about a logo for his personal brand _BenCodeZen_ and I DELIVERED. Introducing _Destinio!_

Initial concepts were around dragons, Zen, and monograms.

I was about to ship the Cute dragon design, but something was feeling off. It was looking a bit dopey.

The big change was bringing the outer circular shape up around its chest to its head. This did two things. 

1. It changed the position of head & neck so it was more up and back, giving it a more confident posture.
2. It allowed the underbelly color to connect to the head, thus removing the need for an outline.

These changes made the dragon look more active and ready-to-rumble. It was a solid improvement, making for a simpler composition and a more iconic emblem.
